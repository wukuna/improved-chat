# Improved Chat and Overlays

Give each conversation its own space. Create chat overlays with independent channels, filters, fonts, colours and alerts, including optional RGB text and borders. Resize or collapse the native chatbox, tidy channel labels and menus, distinguish offline clan members, and make dialogue easier to read. Enable only the features you want.

## Getting started

1. Use the normal plugin settings for native chatbox size, collapse controls, cleanup, opacity and dialogue styling.
2. Open the side panel to create an overlay. Choose its message types and when it should appear.
3. Use **Messages**, **Appearance** and **Notifications** to configure that overlay, then try **Preview (10 seconds)** while logged in.

Previously **Improved Chat**. Existing settings, overlay positions and profiles are retained.

## Usage

### Custom overlays

Create and manage multiple overlays from the **Improved Chat and Overlays** side panel.

Start with a preset, then turn on **Enabled**, choose **Message Types**, and set **Show overlay** in the **Messages** tab. **Show overlay** selects whether the overlay appears only with the chatbox hidden or with it open too. New custom overlays have no message types selected until you choose them. An overlay appears only when it has messages or an input preview; choosing “With chatbox open or hidden” does not draw an empty frame.

Use **Preview (10 seconds)** while logged in to check appearance without waiting for chat. Preview bypasses content filters and normal visibility conditions; its sample messages never enter chat history. Use **Open Plugin Settings** for native chat features and global defaults.

The compact overlay list stays above the editor. Select an overlay, then use **Messages**, **Appearance**, or **Notifications**. Each overlay has a direct enable switch. Changes save automatically as you edit. The editor supports duplicating an overlay, confirms deletion, preserves your scroll position when dependent controls change, and provides a background opacity percentage. Deleting every overlay stays empty after restart. Creating Game Alerts uses the same game-message selection as the first-run preset; existing saved selections are preserved.

**Clear [overlay] history** clears only that overlay's view. Native chat-tab history clearing still applies to all overlays showing those message types. **Collapse Duplicates** groups consecutive matching messages within each overlay's filtered view and keeps channels, senders, and incoming/outgoing messages separate. Captured history remains intact so clearing or filtering one overlay cannot remove another overlay's messages. History is held for the current plugin session.

Each overlay can independently control:

- enabled state, name, maximum messages, and fade duration;
- message types shown;
- free placement or placement above/below your character;
- X/Y offsets for player-attached overlays;
- text size, font, alignment, bold styling, and width;
- horizontal/vertical padding;
- background color and transparency;
- border color and thickness;
- timestamps;
- dynamic height and always-visible behavior;
- duplicate-count display;
- input preview and "only while typing" behavior;
- overlay-only text-color override;
- attention effects for the message, border, and background.

RuneLite's normal overlay movement system is used for free-position overlays.

#### RGB animation (Beta)

In each overlay's **Appearance** tab, enable **Border** and **RGB Clockwise Border (Beta)** for a rainbow that travels around the perimeter. **Text effect** offers solid/channel colors, **RGB Static** by word or character, **RGB Cycling (Beta)**, and **RGB Wave (Beta)**. Cycling can fade between **Color 1** and **Color 2**, or use the full spectrum. Wave uses all colors. **RGB cycle (seconds)** sets the duration; higher values are slower. Border and text effects are independent and off by default.

Animation affects only the custom overlay, including its names, timestamps and input preview. Migrated overlays preserve their former precedence. **Messages → Message highlights → Highlights override defaults** lets a matching rule override the message body while unmatched messages retain the default effect. Icons retain their original colors. Wrapping, shadows, underline/strikethrough styling, message fading and attention flashes remain available. Border Color retains its transparency setting when RGB is enabled. Use **Preview (10 seconds)** while logged in to try the effects. These Beta effects still need live gameplay feedback.

### Overlay filtering

#### Message replacer (Beta)

In an overlay's **Messages → Message replacer (Beta)** section, enable the feature and choose **Add replacement** for each message you want to customize. Each rule has **Original message**, **Show instead**, and its own enable checkbox. Edits save automatically. For example, match `Your thrall returns to the grave.` and show `You need to summon a thrall!`.

Rules match the complete message, ignoring case and chat colors. The first enabled, complete rule wins. Replacement text is displayed literally and never triggers another replacement. Blank or disabled rules leave messages unchanged. **Test replacements** previews the result without logging in or adding anything to chat.

Replacement affects only that overlay's displayed message body. The real chatbox, captured history, filters, message highlights and notification triggers still use the original message. Sender labels, timestamps, duplicate counts, wrapping and fading remain available. The feature is off by default and remains Beta pending live feedback.

Filtering can be global or completely independent per overlay.

- **Use Chat Filter Globally** applies the RuneLite global Chat Filter path to every overlay.
- **Use Global Chat Filter** applies that global filter only to the selected overlay.
- Otherwise, each overlay can use:
  - **Off**
  - **Hide Matches**
  - **Show Only Matches**
- Custom filters support:
  - filtered words;
  - case-insensitive regex rules;
  - sender/name rules;
  - literal sender matching;
  - sender regex rules using a `regex:` prefix.

Invalid custom regex lines are ignored safely.

The editor reports invalid filter line numbers as you edit and warns when Show Only Matches has no usable rules. Use the sample player-name and message fields to test custom content rules. Literal names match part of a name; use `regex:^Alice$` for an exact name. The tester does not test channel selection or visibility.

When the global override is active, custom controls are disabled but their saved values are retained. The editor also reports when RuneLite's Chat Filter plugin is disabled, in which case selecting the global filter does not apply content filtering.

Different overlays can therefore show different subsets of the same shared chat history without removing messages from the shared message pool.

### Clan display and offline status

Clan presentation can be configured separately for every overlay.

Per-overlay controls include:

- **Show Clan Rank Icons**
- **Show Offline Status**
- **Show Offline Icon**
- **Color Offline Names**
- **Offline Color**

Clan, guest-clan, and Group Ironman chat are supported.

Overlay offline presentation is independent of the native-chat **Offline Clan Status** setting, so one can be enabled without the other.

Native offline status adds an icon; native name colors remain under RuneLite Chat Color. Custom offline name colors remain available in each overlay.

### Message colors, rules, and alerts

Improved Chat and Overlays can use RuneLite Chat Color as its baseline color source or configured fallback colors for game, public, private, friends, clan, guest clan, Group Ironman, trade, challenge, broadcast, autochat, and other supported message types.

#### Message Color Rules

Rules affect only the selected overlay. Open **Messages → Message highlights** to edit its definitions and nine-color palette. Native chat text uses RuneLite Chat Color.

Use one rule per line:

```text
is about to expire::1
has expired::1::flash
regex:^Your .* count is:.*::2
```

- `::1` through `::9` select one of nine configurable rule colors.
- Prefix a rule with `regex:` for a case-insensitive regular expression.
- Add `::flash` to trigger overlay attention behavior.
- Player-authored chat is excluded by default and can be enabled separately.

#### Overlay Rainbow Rules

RGB highlight patterns affect the selected overlay only. Choose Use overlay default, RGB Static (by word or character), RGB Cycling, or RGB Wave. Existing rainbow patterns retain their static style and word/character selection.

```text
achieved a new
has reached
regex:^Collection log.*
```

#### Overlay attention controls

Each overlay can independently configure:

- whether attention flashing is enabled;
- what triggers it;
- whether it can flash while RuneLite is focused;
- stop behavior;
- duration;
- speed;
- message flashing;
- border flashing;
- background flashing.

### Native chat resizing

Improved Chat and Overlays can resize RuneLite's native chatbox in both **resizable** and **fixed** layouts.

Available controls include:

- resizable height and width changes;
- fixed-layout height changes;
- private split-chat width adjustment and live rewrapping;
- optional resizing of chat-tab buttons;
- interface-height growth when the chatbox grows;
- camera adjustment in fixed mode when growing chat;
- hideable fixed chat;
- automatic reversion for dialogue and interface/modal screens;
- Resource Pack compatibility controls to avoid drawing resize borders or stretching custom chatbox artwork.

#### Drag resizing

Set a **Drag-Resize Modifier** and hold it while dragging a chat border.

Drag resizing also supports:

- live rewrapping;
- a configurable drag indicator color.

#### Secondary chat size

Configure a second chat size and switch to it with a keybind.

The secondary size supports its own height/width changes and hold/toggle behavior.

### Collapsible chat

The native chatbox can collapse to a single compact button.

Controls include:

- collapse/restore keybind;
- static button text or Report-button text;
- transparent button mode;
- configurable button and hover text;
- unread colors for public, private, friends chat, clan, and trade activity.

### Native chat cleanup and presentation

Cleanup options work independently and can be enabled only where wanted.

#### General cleanup

- remove the welcome message;
- wrapped-message indentation controls;
- hide the chat scrollbar;
- remove special-attack chat text;
- fixed-width timestamps with a reserved pixel column for consistent alignment.

#### Channel color bar

Add an optional per-message channel color marker with configurable offset and width.

Separate colors can be configured for:

- no-channel messages;
- friends chat;
- clan;
- guest clan;
- Group Ironman.

#### Clan cleanup

Controls include:

- remove clan startup messages;
- remove or replace the clan name;
- remove clan rank icons.

#### Guest clan cleanup

Controls include:

- remove reconnecting messages;
- remove or replace the guest-clan name.

#### Group Ironman cleanup

Controls include:

- remove or replace the Group Ironman name;
- move Group Ironman broadcasts.

#### Friends Chat cleanup

Controls include:

- remove or replace the Friends Chat name;
- remove "Attempting to join" messages;
- remove "Now talking in" messages.

#### Chat menu cleanup

**Remove Chat Options** simplifies right-click menus on chat messages.

An optional **Remove Lookup** setting can remove the player Lookup entry as well. Holding Control provides temporary access to the normal options.

### Chatbox opacity

Native-chat opacity controls include:

- chatbox opacity;
- chat-button opacity;
- optional opacity for dialogue and menus shown in the chat area.

### Dialogue text styling

Customize supported RuneLite/OSRS dialogue text with:

- font family;
- font size;
- bold text;
- anti-aliasing;
- option-menu font size;
- line spacing;
- shadow color.

Styling can be enabled independently for:

- NPC dialogue;
- player dialogue;
- option menus;
- item/action dialogue.

### Per-overlay notifications

Each overlay has a **Notifications** tab in its editor. Notifications start disabled. Enable them for all new matching messages or only messages matching a `::flash` color rule. Overlays switched off with **Enabled**, filtered messages, outgoing messages and RuneLite console notifications do not trigger alerts. Notifications follow the **Enabled** switch; an enabled overlay can still notify while its **Show overlay** visibility condition temporarily hides it. Repainting, loading history and delayed message formatting do not replay notifications. Each enabled matching overlay sends its own alert.

Use RuneLite defaults, or enable **Customize Notification** for independent desktop notifications, Native/Custom/Off sound, volume, focus behavior, window flashing and color, timeout, and chatbox notification. Custom sounds use a WAV filename in RuneLite's notifications folder; blank uses its default custom sound. Playback and operating-system notifications are handled by RuneLite's shared Notifier, as with Idle Notifier. These controls are independent of the existing overlay Attention flashing.

Native private-chat hiding keeps the system-update timer visible. Overlay login/logout messages respect the game's Off setting. Game and clan payload prefixes are removed only for their native message types; literal pipes in player chat stay intact. Overlay text supports native underline, strike, shadow, line-break and quest-name template formatting.

## Saved settings

Custom text rules have safety limits to keep chat responsive. Expressions may contain up to 1,024 characters, with up to 128 rules per list and 32,768 characters per rule source. Matching stops when a rule exceeds its work budget; the rule is skipped until it is recompiled after an edit. If an overlay filter cannot be evaluated safely, its messages remain visible. The side panel explains when a limit was reached, and saved rule text is retained. These limits apply to Improved Chat's evaluation, not other plugins' matching engines.

Saved overlay lists are limited to 64 overlays and two million JSON characters, with a nesting limit checked before parsing. Unreadable bounded configurations retain a recovery backup. Oversized configurations remain in their original setting and automatic saving pauses; export the RuneLite profile before using the existing Reset overlays action to deliberately replace them.

The native plugin menu has five collapsible sections: **Chatbox**, **Chat cleanup**, **Overlay setup: side panel**, **Dialogue text**, and **Advanced**. Secondary sizing and its hotkey remain in Chatbox. Clan, guest-clan, friends-chat and GIM name controls remain independent of their instruction controls.

Use the side panel for individual overlays, custom text colors, RGB effects, notifications and Message highlights. Existing setting keys, overlay IDs, placements, filters and notification settings are retained. Former global color rules, their nine palette colors, RGB patterns, spread and fallback colors are copied into each existing overlay once. Old cycling remains full spectrum. The old overlay list is backed up under `overlayConfigsBeforeMenuCleanup`; legacy global values remain stored. New overlays have independent defaults. Unreadable configurations keep the existing recovery backup and are not overwritten merely by startup.

A one-time chatbox notice explains the rename. Collection Log keeps its native window handling.

## Compatibility

### RuneLite Chat Color, Chat Filter, and Emojis

Improved Chat and Overlays integrates with RuneLite's built-in chat systems rather than replacing them. Overlay rendering preserves supported emoji/icon tags, can use RuneLite Chat Color as a baseline, and can opt overlays into the RuneLite global Chat Filter path.

### Resource Packs

If a Resource Pack uses custom chatbox artwork, **Don't Draw Resize Borders** and **Don't Zoom Background** help prevent the resize system from framing or stretching that artwork.

### Modern Chat

Improved Chat and Overlays can run alongside **Modern Chat** by **BenDol**. When Modern Chat owns conflicting native-chat geometry, visibility, or presentation, Improved Chat and Overlays yields those conflicting native features while unrelated Improved Chat and Overlays features remain available.

### Chat Widgets and Force Recolor

Improved Chat and Overlays declares conflicts with **Chat Widgets** and **Force Recolor**. Use one plugin for each overlapping overlay or recolouring role. The recipe below explains their contributions and the features available here.

## Inspiration and recipe

The recipe is movable chat widgets, a flexible native chatbox and clear message presentation. Improved Chat and Overlays builds on work from Chat Widgets, Chat Resizer, Collapse Chat, ChatboxOpacity, Dialogue Fonts, Clean Chat, Remove Chat Options and Offline Chat Icon. Force Recolor also informed the familiar text::number colour-rule style. Each contribution is credited in the code notices.
